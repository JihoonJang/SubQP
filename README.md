# SubgraphQueryProcessing
Subgraph Query Processing. Handles multiple data graphs given as (name, path) pairs. 

VEQ-S [1] is internally used to solve the problem. 

## Environment
Subgraph Query Processing requires python3 running on a machine with 64 bit CentOS Linux.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SNUCSE-CTA/SubgraphQueryProcessing
```

## Usage
```sh
python SubgraphQueryProcessing.py <Graph list path> <Query graph path>
```

Graph list file contains name and path for multiple data graphs;
```text
name1 path1
name2 path2
...
```

Query graph path must be a path to GFU file. 

## Output
Outputs list of [name] of graphs which contains the specified query as subgraphs.
